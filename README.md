# Infinite-Jump-Datapack

This little project of mine where I tried to create the Jump and Run from the Minecraft server GommeHD as good as possible in the form of a datapack.

To start the Jump and Run on a player, the command `function 2mal3:inju/start` must be executed as and at the player. After that the jump and run continues until the player fails a jump.
